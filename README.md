# BlueDashPro
New, working, and rewritten version of [BlueDash](https://github.com/sykeben/BlueDash).   

**Documentation**  
All documentation will be in the [wiki](https://github.com/sykeben/BlueDashPro/wiki) (which may be outdated), please head there if needed.   

**Support**  
If something isn't working, or you want to suggest a feature, write an [issue](https://github.com/sykeben/BlueDashPro/issues). I currently am not the best at Client-Side JS (the type with DOM) and may not be able to fix certain things.

**Issues I Need Help With**
If anybody is willing, please check the [issues](https://github.com/sykeben/BlueDashPro/issues) page and try to help others with bugs, feature requests, etc. I have been having trouble fixing some issues as they are a bit bizzare in the way they happen, or the way they simply don't work. If you can fix an issue, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/sykeben/BlueDashPro/pulls) with your code and I will be able to verify it works. Anybody who helps me by fixing an issue will have their GitHub username credited below.

**Issue Fixers**
Special thanks to those who helped me fix issues:
